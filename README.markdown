Team Track Enhancements For Trenders (tte4t)
============================================

Using Team Track isn't a good experience, since there are so many fields that
make you lose focus. This project tries to use various method to enhance the
user experience, and our productivity.

Enhancements via Stylish
------------------------

[Stylish for Firefox][sf] or [Stylish for Chrome][sc] extensions allow us to
personalize our web surfing experience. The tt4t.css script is the user style
that can be installed into Stylish, thus providing us a better looking Team
Track.

      "Stylish for Chrome"

Development Plan
----------------

Let's first using Stylish to customize Team Track UI, to find out the desired
way to help us focus on most important things.

The next step can be switching from Stylish to Greasemonkey, which allow us to
use user script (javascript) to modify page behaviors. For example, hide
uninterested sections initially.

The third step is to allow customization, since different Trender may have
different preference.
