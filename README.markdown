Team Track Enhancements For Trenders (tte4t)
============================================

Using Team Track isn't a good experience, since there are so many fields that
may make you lose focus. This project tries to use various methods to enhance
the user experience, hence increase our productivity.

Enhancements via Stylish
------------------------

[Stylish for Firefox][sf] or [Stylish for Chrome][sc] extensions allow us to
personalize our web surfing experience. The tte4t.css script is the user style
that can be installed into Stylish, thus providing us a better looking Team
Track.

Development Plan
----------------

Here is a roughly plan to develop tte4t:

1. Let's first using Stylish to customize Team Track UI, to find out the
   desired way to help us focus on most important things.

2. The next step can be switching from Stylish to Greasemonkey, which allow us
   to use user script (javascript) to modify page behaviors. For example, hide
   uninterested sections initially.

3. The third step is to allow customization, since different Trender may have
   different preference.

We're in step 1 currently.
