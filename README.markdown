Trender Tools for Enhancing Our Development Environment
=======================================================

There are some rooms to enhance in the development infrastructures we trenders
use day by day. This project tries to use some uninstrusive way to optimize the
infrastructures to increase our productivity.

Enhancements via Stylish
------------------------

[Stylish for Firefox][sf] or [Stylish for Chrome][sc] extensions allow us to
personalize our web surfing experience. The tte4t.css script is the user style
that can be installed into Stylish, thus providing us a better looking Team
Track.

Development Plan
----------------

Here is a roughly plan to develop trender-tools:

1. Let's first using Stylish to customize infrastructure web interface, to find
   out the desired way to help us focus on most important things.

2. The next step can be switching from Stylish to Greasemonkey, which allow us
   to use user script (javascript) to modify page behaviors. For example, hide
   uninterested sections initially.

3. The third step is to allow customization, since different Trender may have
   different preference.

We're in step 1 currently.
